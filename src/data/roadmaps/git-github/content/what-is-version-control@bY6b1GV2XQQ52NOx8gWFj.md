# What is Version Control?
- **Version control** is a system that tracks and manages changes to files, code, or documents over time.
- It allows multiple users to collaborate on a project while maintaining a history of all changes.
- Users can revert to previous versions if needed which ensuring **data integrity** and facilitating collaboration.
- Version control supports continuous integration and deployment **(CI/CD)** processes, enabling automated testing and deployment of code changes.
- They offer a safety net by enabling developers to revert to previous code versions in the event of errors or bugs.
